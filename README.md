## Description
For this project I have created a program that can be run in the terminal to generate a README.md file for any project you are working on. Just answer all the questions, and the README will populate with your input and the file will write.

## Installation
:toolbox:<br>
To run this README generator, you will be using node. First need to open your gitbash terminal and navigate to the folder that you want the README to be generated in. Once there, you can run **npm init** to initialize the project if you have not already done so. Lastly, you will need to make sure that inquirer is installed by running the **npm install inquirer** command in the bash terminal. You are now ready to run the program!

## Usage
:books:<br>
To use this application, run the program by using the command **node index.js** in the terminal. A series of questions will then prompt you for input. Put in as much detail as you need for each question before pressing enter and moving on to the next question. Once all of the questions have been answered, a README.md file will be generated in the folder you have run the program in with all your input formatted into a nice and neat readme. Run the program as many times as you need!
